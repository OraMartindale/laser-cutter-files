# Laser Cutter Files

This is a collection of SVG files that I built to use with my laser cutter. Please download, laser cut and modify them.

## Uno Logo

<img src="uno-logo.svg" width="300" alt="UNO Logo">

I grabbed the UNO logo from wikipedia, but it it had a bunch of overlapping layers which caused overlapping lazer engraving. So I used the image as my source and created a file with no overlapping layers for good laser cuttting.
