# Laser Cutter Files

This is a collection of SVG files that I built to use with my laser cutter. Please download, laser cut and modify them.

## Uno Logo

I grabbed the UNO logo from wikipedia, but it it had a bunch of overlapping layers which caused overlapping lazer engraving. So I used the image as my source and created a file with no overlapping layers for good laser cuttting.

## Storm Trooper Bookmark

My love for Star Wars quickly showed itself in a few early laser cutting projects including this bookmark. This file could also be used with a vinyl cutter if you have one.

## Bottle Cap Coaster

Take your bottlecaps and insert them into this coaster. I saw several [Etsy shops selling these](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=bottle%20cap%20coaster) and I thought *I can make that myself*. It took a bit of experimenting to get the size right and add some pegs in the openings to hold the bottle caps, but I'm happy with the results.

Some tips if you use this one:
* If you don't want the bottle caps to extend above the wood, use 1/4 inch thick wood instead of 1/8.
* Buy some [cork coasters](https://www.hobbylobby.com/crafts-hobbies/wood-crafts-blank-surfaces/cork-boards/square-cork-coasters---6-pack/p/80913345) and use them on the underside of your bottle cap coaster
* Consider spraying with a [non-slip coating](https://www.amazon.com/Odif-43602-Grippy-Non-Slip-Coating/dp/B07PNRR717) so glassware doesn't slip off the smooth caps

## Blade Runner Unicorn

The iconic shape of Gaff's origami unicorn in an SVG that you can laser cut or vinyl cut.

## Starbucks Cup

One of the most fun parts of laser cutting is creating shapes that you don't think you should be able to do with wood, including cylinders and cones. I was thinking about this while buying a coffee at Starbucks and the inspiration struck to create the shape with my laser cutter.

I disassembled the cup, traced its outline onto a piece of paper and carefully reproduced it as an SVG.

In order to create a rounded shape you cut a series of lines that run parallel to each other in a tight formation. I started with a box design I downloaded from [Boxes.py](https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de/) that had a flexible hinge. I extracted that flexible hinge into its own file and then began adjusting the lines to form a cone instead of being parallel.

I'm not including the Starbuck's logo in my file for copyright reasons, but the original looked like this:
