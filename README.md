# Laser Cutter Files

This is a collection of SVG files that I built to use with my laser cutter. Please download, laser cut and modify them.

## Uno Logo

I grabbed the UNO logo from wikipedia, but it it had a bunch of overlapping layers which caused overlapping lazer engraving. So I used the image as my source and created a file with no overlapping layers for good laser cuttting.

## Storm Trooper Bookmark

My love for Star Wars quickly showed itself in a few early laser cutting projects including this bookmark. This file could also be used with a vinyl cutter if you have one.
